## Project summary

This repository presents a complete solution for enhancing the Indian Pines Hyperspectral Image (HSI) dataset. The central focus is the implementation of all the required algorithms from scratch (e.g., Log Transform, Histogram Equalisation, Sobel Edge Detection), demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical principles. Crucially, no library codes were used for the core image processing functions.

Implemented algorithms:
- Log transform
- Gamma correction
- Contrast stretching
- Histogram equalization
- Convolution filters:
  - Mean (average) filter
  - Gradient filters (edge detection)
